# Asteroids clone in pyglet (OpenGL for Python)
I wanted to learn some basic game development in OpenGL and Python. Pyglet is very good for this kind of thing. Unfortunately it seems to have a less active community compared to Pygame (but in my opinion Pyglet seems much more Pythonic in its design). My game will not win any awards since it is a Asteroids clone. But it has some other features like:

* Bullets have recoil and will slightly accelerate the ship rearwards when shooting.
* Game graphics from a [professional artist.](https://studiooddball.com)

When I started this list I thought there would be more features but I think this is it.
